# Mapping_Earthquakes
Use JavaScriptâ€™s Leaflet library along with the Mapbox API to create visualizations of earthquake data from the U.S. Geological Survey

# Overview:

Creating interactive maps that are easy to use is a necessary skill for someone in data visualization. From the New York Times to projects for the Center for Strategic International Studies, maps allow us to explore, understand and make decisions about our world. I will be buliding up on my JavaScript skills in the d3 library, and create an interactive world. I'll use geo JSON, the type of JSON file specifically designed to host geographic information. Geo JSON data can be found in many apps that have a mapping feature such as ride sharing, navigation, and food and package delivery services. Even the apps on our smartphone that allow us to track our location can store and use geo JSON data. The Geo JSON format is the industry standard for representing simple geographical features and non spatial attributes. I will explore geographical features such as points which contain addresses and locations like latitude, longitude coordinates, line strings, which contain coordinates for the boundaries of streets, highways, travel routes, and tectonic plates, and polygons, which contain coordinates for the boundaries of zip codes, counties countries, provinces, and tracts of land. I'll also explore nonspatial app, which is data that is independent of all geometric considerations and packaged in the hierarchical structure. Geo JSON file examples include elevation, temperature, random accumulation, hail size, tornado or hurricane strength, and the magnitude of an earthquake. Using my knowledge of JavaScript and the d3 library, I will traverse and retrieve geo JSON earthquake data and tectonic plate data in order to populate a geographical map. For this i'll also use the leaflet library and the map box API. Let's get started using data from a geo json file to populate a geographical map using JavaScript and the d3 leaflet Library.
